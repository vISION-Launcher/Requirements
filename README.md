# Requirements
- Apache or nginx webserver
  - You need this to host the web API server
  - I strongly recommend hosting the API on a **VPS** or **Dedicated server**
  - It's not recommended to host the API on the same webserver with your website
  - Because of high traffics of downloads and API requests your site may slow down
- Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 or 2022
  - You need this to compile the launcher
  - Make sure you selected [.NET desktop development workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) when installed
