# Requirements
- Apache or nginx webserver
  - I strongly recommend hosting the API on a **VPS** or **Dedicated server**
  - It's not recommended to host the API on the same webserver with your website
  - Because of high traffics of downloads and API requests your site may slow down


# Webserver extensions
- GMP
- Soap
- Mysqli
